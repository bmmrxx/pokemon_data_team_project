### Purpose: 
We want to create two PowerBi dashboards. The first dashboard will visualize data about specific pokemon. The second dashboard will be a battle assistant dashboard. Which will gives us the best possible ways to win your battle!! 


### Scope: 
Our first dashboard will show all types of insights about each pokemon. This includes data about the different evolutions and all personal info about the pokemon.
The second dashboard will give you all info about your pokemon fighting stats. It will let you compare your pokemon against the pokemon you are fighting to generate the best possible way to win your battle.

### User Stories and Tasks:
