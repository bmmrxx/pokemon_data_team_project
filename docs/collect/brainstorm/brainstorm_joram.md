My list of idea's:

1. A Power BI project with multiple pages with insights about the pokemon data.
2. A way to make it easy to predict fights between pokemon you select within the power bi. So you get a insight about the fight you are about to have.
2. A Jupyther Notebook to create some deeper insights about the pokemon data we are not able to create w PowerBi, and also make it able to work together with the front-end team to make them able to use our visuals on their website.
3. PokeApi to gather all the data we need.
